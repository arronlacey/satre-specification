# ‚ú® Contributing to the SATRE Specification

## [Jump straight to contribution process](#contribution-process)

üéâ  **Welcome to the SATRE specification repository!** üéâ
_We're excited that you want to contribute_ üöÄ

We want to ensure that every user and contributor feels welcome, included and supported to participate in the SATRE project & community.
We hope that the information provided in this document will make it as easy as possible for you to get involved.

We welcome all contributions to this project via GitHub issues.
Please follow these guidelines to make sure your contributions can be easily integrated into the project.
As you start contributing don't forget that your ideas are more important than perfectly formatted contributions ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know through one of the many ways to [get in touch](#get-in-touch).

## Code of Conduct

SATRE is a community-led and collaboratively developed project.
We, therefore, require that all our contributors and their contributions **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (CoC)**.
Please familiarise yourself with our [CoC](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and ensure your contributions and engagement with this project follow it!

## Contributing Through GitHub

[Git][git] is a really useful tool for version control.
[GitHub][github] sits on top of Git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

We know that it can be daunting to start using Git and GitHub if you haven't worked with them in the past, but we are here to help you figure out any of the jargon or confusing instructions you encounter! :heart:

In order to contribute via GitHub, you'll need to set up a free account and sign in.
Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to help you get going.
Remember that you can ask us any questions you need to along the way.

## Contribution Model

We have designed our contribution model to be as accessible as possible, whilst utilising the full power of GitHub's open, collaborative and version control toolkit.
This specification, including its governnance procedures and contribution models, are open for the community to evaluate, challenge, amend and discuss. If you have improvements we can make to anything we are doing, please suggest them!
The community can suggest any amendments to the specification at any point - if you see a part of the specification you don't like, open an issue about it and start a conversation with the community ‚ú®

### Specification Format

The specification will live on the [specification repository](https://github.com/sa-tre/satre-specification) in MarkDown format.

The final and most up-to-date 'source of truth' will be the specification on the main branch of this repository.

The community can decide at any point whether a version of the specification should be made, released, published, or stored elsewhere.

This will be its own self-contained repository so that the version control is clean on updates to the specification specifically, or governance around it.
Any contributions to the wider SATRE project should be made through a different medium via the [SATRE GitHub organisation](https://github.com/sa-tre), or by contacting the SATRE team at [satre-contact@dundee.ac.uk](mailto:satre-contact@dundee.ac.uk)

### Contribution Process

All contributions & discussions will take place in issues - including the drafting of content.
This is to provide as accessible as possible an environment for all contributors to engage in the conversation.

To contribute to the project:

1. Open an issue on this repo. If your issue is for a discussion, add a `discussion point` label. If it is for a proposed change to the repo, add a `proposed change` label and provide wording for the proposed change. If it is for a governance discussion or change, add a `governance` label.
1. Have a discussion with the community within the issue comments. All issues will be left open for a minimum of 7 days to allow community members to engage if they want to.
1. If your issue is a proposed change, amend the wording of the contribution as required.
1. Once the final wording is ready for review,  add the label `request review`.
1. The issue will be reviewed at the next regular SATRE meeting by the SATRE team. Approval requires a simply majority, with at least 3 votes.
1. If the issue is not approved, the SATRE team will provide reasons why in the comments of the issue.
1. If the issue is approved, the label `approved change` will be added by the SATRE team, along with a comment updating the contributors/community that engaged with the issue.
1. The Pull Request (PR) is built (either by the contributor or by the SATRE team) with the wording as finalised in the issue
1. The PR is merged, and the issue is closed.

### Consensus Mechanism

Approval from the SATRE team is based on [lazy consensus](https://medlabboulder.gitlab.io/democraticmediums/mediums/lazy_consensus/).
Once an issue has been open for 7 days, unless there are outstanding objections within the comments, the SATRE team will approve the change.
If any of the SATRE team objects to a particular issue, this will be raised by individuals in the comments of the issue.
The SATRE team will only approve issues that have no outstanding objections.
We will take all cues from community contributions.

### Important Notes

We are in a bootstrapping phase to get an initial specification written. As part of this initial work we will propose a more formal governance model for the specification going forwards.

We have chosen to keep all discussion to issues for now, so contributors have a single place to engage in conversation. This is why we only open a PR once wording is finalised (to not split the conversation), and have opted to not use Discussions to begin with.

The community can suggest governance changes at any point. This includes the SATRE team, and any decision must be openly documented in the repo.

## Writing in Markdown

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

Most of the writing that you'll do will be in [Markdown][markdown].
You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting.
For example, you could write words as **bold** (`**bold**`), or in _italics_ (`_italics_`), or as a [link][rick-roll] (`[link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.

Also when writing in Markdown, please start each new sentence on a new line.
Having each sentence on a new line will make no difference to how the text is displayed, there will still be paragraphs, but it makes the [diffs produced during the pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-comparing-branches-in-pull-requests) review easier to read! :sparkles:

## SATRE Team Contributions

SATRE team members are free to contribute to the repo in the same way as any contributor‚Äîby opening issues, having a discussion with the community and submitting issues for approval to the SATRE team following the process above.
The SATRE team is also doing ongoing work to identify the key features of this specification.
Some contributions by SATRE team members may represent the output of this work.
Any contribution that represents this work will be explicitly mentioned in the contribution.

This work is taking on two main forms:

1. Identifying what features the community feels are important for a TRE via the [features survey](https://dundee.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/satre-tre-operatorsbuilders-survey). We will synthesise responses from this survey to suggest features here.
1. Evaluating the TREs used in production as part of [the Alan Turing Institute](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven),  [Microsoft's Azure TRE](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureTRE), and the [TREEHOOSE TRE](https://github.com/HicResearch/TREEHOOSE/tree/v1.0.0-beta1). The SATRE team will make recommendations for features of the specification based on similarities/differences across these three TRE provisions.

## Get in Touch

To get in touch with the SATRE team, please email [satre-contact@dundee.ac.uk](mailto: satre-contact@dundee.ac.uk)

## Recognising Contributions

We welcome and recognise all kinds of contributions, from discussing ideas, suggesting features, improving governance, maintaining the project, and more.

This project follows the [all-contributors][all-contributors] specifications.
The all-contributors bot usage is described [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage).

To add yourself or someone else as a contributor, comment on the relevant Issue or Pull Request with the following:

```
@all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>
```

You can see the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of valid `<contribution>` types.
The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor and reply with the pull request details.

**PLEASE NOTE: Only one contributor can be added with the bot at a time!**
Add each contributor in turn, merge the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`) before adding another one.
Otherwise, you can end up with dreaded [merge conflicts][github-mergeconflicts].
Therefore, please check the open pull requests first to make sure there aren't any [open requests from the bot](https://github.com/sa-tre/satre-specification/pulls/app%2Fallcontributors) before adding another.

What happens if you accidentally run the bot before the previous run was merged and you got those pesky merge conflicts?
(Don't feel bad, we have all done it! üôà)
Simply close the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`).
If you are unable to do this for any reason, please let us know by opening an issue, and SATRE  team members will be very happy to help!
